<h1>Instant Ramen Fried Rice</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This isn't just drunk food; it's survival food.</p>
<p>There's very little to say about the technique here: This is supposed to be easy and near-instant, so trying to
    optimize for every step pretty much defeats the purpose. Plus, it's delicious, so there's really no need to
    overthink it.</p>
<p>But don't worry; we promise this is hot-damn good!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>One 2.5-ounce (71g) cup instant ramen noodles, such as Cup Noodles, in flavor of your choice</li>
    <li>Boiling water</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons (45ml) canola oil or other neutral oil</li>
    <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    <li>1 cup (7 3/4 ounces; 220g) cooked medium- or short-grain rice (see note)</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Transfer contents of instant noodles cup (dried noodles plus all seasonings and mix-ins) to a zipper-lock bag or
        mixing bowl. Crush noodles well into roughly rice-size pieces, but don't obsess about it.</li>
    <li>Return crushed noodles and seasonings to cup.</li>
    <li>Add just enough boiling water to wet contents of cup but no more than that. Cover and let stand while you
        continue with the recipe.</li>
    <li>In a large nonstick skillet, wok, cast iron, or carbon steel pan, heat oil over high heat until shimmering. Add
        egg and cook, stirring, until just scrambled.</li>
    <li>Add rice and cook, stirring constantly and breaking up any small lumps, until heated through and glazed in the
        oil, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add soaked ramen along with any liquid and cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until excess moisture has
        cooked off and rice and noodles are lightly golden and toasted, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt.</li>
    <li>Transfer to a serving platter or pack into a heatproof bowl, then invert bowl on a plate to make a compact mound
        of rice.</li>
    <li>If a heartier meal is desired, you can whip up a 4-egg omelette following the instructions in our omurice recipe
        and unfurl it on top of the mound of rice; top with ketchup and anything else you want (nori flakes are shown
        here) before serving.</li>
