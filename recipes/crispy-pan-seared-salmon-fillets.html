<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>4 skin-on salmon fillets, about 6 ounces (170g) each</li>
    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable, canola, or light olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Press salmon fillets between paper towels to dry surfaces thoroughly. Season on all sides with salt and pepper.
    </li>
    <li>In a large stainless, cast iron, or carbon steel skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering.
        Reduce heat to medium-low, then add a salmon fillet, skin side down. Press firmly in place for 10 seconds, using
        the back of a flexible fish spatula, to prevent the skin from buckling. Add remaining fillets one at a time,
        pressing each with spatula for 10 seconds, until all fillets are in the pan.</li>
    <li>Cook, pressing gently on back of fillets occasionally to ensure good contact with skin, until skin releases
        easily from pan, about 4 minutes. If skin shows resistance when you attempt to lift a corner with spatula, allow
        it to continue to cook until it lifts easily. Continue to cook until salmon registers 110°F (43°C) in the very
        center for rare, 120°F (49°C) for medium-rare, or 130°F (54°C) for medium, 5 to 7 minutes total.</li>
    <li>Using spatula and a fork, flip salmon fillets and cook on second side for 15 seconds, then transfer to a paper
        towel–lined plate to drain. Serve.</li>
